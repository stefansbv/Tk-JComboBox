Revision history for Perl extension Tk::JComboBox.

1.06 Bug Fix for JComboBox, fixes to Test Code

   - Ken Prows reported bug to CPAN Bug Tracker #12372
     JComboBox was interfering with grab. Ken suggested
     a solution, which I added. 

     - Added a test to 06_Bugs.t to test the new code.
     - Updated docs to add some mention of grab issues.

   - Testers reported several issues with test cases, and 
     I think I have worked at least some of these out.

     - Found spots where I wasn't destroying a JCombobox
       between test cases which fouled up a few tests. Fixed it.
   
     - Used carp to print labels for tests, so that I can track
       problems more efficiently. My own tests work fine on WinXP
       and Fedora 2 (using Gnome & KDE).

     - Removed line feeds from tests.

1.05 Updated Test Code - No changes to any of the Modules!
    
   - Failed Test Report:
     http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/188280
     By cpan@www.interlab.nl
  
     Reported that I'd Forgotten PREREQ_PM - (how embarrassing)
       - Modfied Makefile.PL accordingly.

     I hope Sébastien doesn't give up on me and stop testing this
     module. I expected it would fail, since I wasn't entirely
     certain what had failed. Unfortunately, this error report
     was tougher to get anything out of than the last one, and the
     fault lies solely with me, since my scripts were apparently 
     so brittle that a few of them died before running even ONE
     test!

     - Modified test scripts making extensive use of eval blocks
     so that problems with one test would kill the entire script.
     Hopefully, the carp calls I've added will give me more helpful
     information on what's going wrong, so that I can fix it. 

1.04 Bug Fix - Response to Failed test report

   - Some options were not being set to an initial value, and 
     were passing undef or "" off as a color. NOTE: this did
     not trigger an error on Win32.
     - Set default values for -highlightbackground, -highlightcolor,
       and -disabledbackground.

   - Noticed that some tests were using methods that expected 
     JComboBox to be packed (TestListwidth). Adjusted setup
     method TestListwidth and TestHighlight to test packed
     widgets, and made sure that update was called immediately
     after pack call. Mods in 02_Basic_Options.t, 
     03_Options_Callback. NOTE: the problem did not trigger
     any errors on Win32.

   - Cleaned code in various Test files, and JComboBox.pm
     - Ensure that I was using single quotes for all uses
       of cget and hash keys. This was done for consistancy
       and possibly older versions of perl.

1.03 Bug Fix - Bug Submitted by Ken Prows - 01 Mar 05

   - Bug (cpan#11707) Fixed: AutoFind was not using listbox->see
     to ensure that an entry in the listbox would be visible
     when it was selected through AutoFind.
     - Added 16 Tests in Test suite to test for bug (06_Bugs.t)
     - Fixed AutoFind sub in JComboBox.pm

   - Updated Construct Call so that JComboBox can only be created
     by a Frame-based widget.
     
1.02 Repaired Broken Test file: accidentally left a MainLoop call in test.
     No code changed. Versions: 1.01, 0.01, 0.02 removed from CPAN.

1.01 Bug Fix and Refactorings

   - Tutorial images were excluded from distribution. Added:
      lib/Tk/JComboBox/jcb_edit.gif
      lib/Tk/JComboBox/jcb_ro.gif

   - Updated -listwidth:
     - Fixed the -listwidth option to work correctly in JComboBox.pm
       the default value and conditions within the code were incorrect
     - Updated JComboBox.pod to include default value for -listwidth
     - added unit tests for -listwidth in 02_Options_Basic.t

   - Replaced majority of "constants" using new CreateGetSet 
     method to create a cleaner way of setting/accessing hashref keys
     The constants were not working as desired.

   - Corrected typos in tutorial.pod based on feedback from 
     Zentara <zentara@highstream.net>

   - Updated -entrybackground:
     - Changed reference to -textbackground option to -entrybackground
       in tutorial.pod
     - corrected -entrybackground configuration in JComboBox::ConfigSpecs.
     - updated description in JComboBox.pod.
     - added unit tests in 02_Options_Basic.t

   - Updated -state option: when set to 'disabled' keyboard traversal using
     Tab was not working correctly. JComboBox should have been skipped.
     - fixed the problem, and added unit test for option in 04+Options_Misc.t

   - Dumbed down test slightly in 04_Options_Misc.t because of problems
     with Tk in Windows 2000. Was unable to correctly generate events for
     <Up> and <Down>. The unit tests were throwing false errors because
     of Tk problems and not JComboBox code. Modified test to call event
     handler directly instead of simulating <Up> or <Down> events.

1.00 Major release with many changes and new features.

   - HTML docs converted to POD format

   - Extensive test suite added

   - Updated -mode option: Now can only be set once, at construction time.
     - documentation updated to reflect this change.

   - Added -autofind option to decouple validation from a find keyboard-based
     find capability. (see docs).

   - Updated subwidget names (kept old ones for backward compatibility).
