Revision history for Perl extension Tk::JComboBox.

1.01 Bug Fix and Refactorings

   - Tutorial images were excluded from distribution. Added:
      lib/Tk/JComboBox/jcb_edit.gif
      lib/Tk/JComboBox/jcb_ro.gif

   - Updated -listwidth:
     - Fixed the -listwidth option to work correctly in JComboBox.pm
       the default value and conditions within the code were incorrect
     - Updated JComboBox.pod to include default value for -listwidth
     - added unit tests for -listwidth in 02_Options_Basic.t

   - Replaced majority of "constants" using new CreateGetSet 
     method to create a cleaner way of setting/accessing hashref keys
     The constants were not working as desired.

   - Corrected typos in tutorial.pod based on feedback from 
     Zentara <zentara@highstream.net>

   - Updated -entrybackground:
     - Changed reference to -textbackground option to -entrybackground
       in tutorial.pod
     - corrected -entrybackground configuration in JComboBox::ConfigSpecs.
     - updated description in JComboBox.pod.
     - added unit tests in 02_Options_Basic.t

   - Updated -state option: when set to 'disabled' keyboard traversal using
     Tab was not working correctly. JComboBox should have been skipped.
     - fixed the problem, and added unit test for option in 04+Options_Misc.t

   - Dumbed down test slightly in 04_Options_Misc.t because of problems
     with Tk in Windows 2000. Was unable to correctly generate events for
     <Up> and <Down>. The unit tests were throwing false errors because
     of Tk problems and not JComboBox code. Modified test to call event
     handler directly instead of simulating <Up> or <Down> events.

1.00 Major release with many changes and new features.

   - HTML docs converted to POD format

   - Extensive test suite added

   - Updated -mode option: Now can only be set once, at construction time.
     - documentation updated to reflect this change.

   - Added -autofind option to decouple validation from a find keyboard-based
     find capability. (see docs).

   - Updated subwidget names (kept old ones for backward compatibility).
