NAME   Tk:JComboBox

DESCRIPTION

  Tk::JComboBox is yet another widget that offers a pull down
menu like Optionmenu, BrowseEntry, ComboEntry among others. It
was created to combine many of the features that I use most
often under an interface very similar to the Java Swing
component by the same name. This widget may have much of
the same functionality, methods, and behavior but it falls
somewhat short of being a clone. I inteded for it to be
similar enough to be easy to learn if one was familiar
with the component.

  There is detailed HTML documentation in the docs
directory, 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

This code started out as Graham Barr's MenuEntry. I liked 
MenuEntry and thought it had lots of promise. So I decided to 
add to it.The more I added (and subtracted), the less it 
looked like like MenuEntry until it got to the point where 
calling it MenuEntry no longer made sense. Thank you Graham 
for provided the fertile soil from which JComboBox grew. Perhaps
someone else will take this widget in directions I hadn't 
forseen as I took yours. - RCS
