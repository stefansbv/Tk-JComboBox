Tk/JComboBox version 1.10
=========================

CHANGES OVERVIEW: (details below)

  New implementation for -textvariable option to correct buggy behavior.
 
OVERVIEW:

JComboBox is a Combo Box implementation that combines several features of the various Combo Box implementations available for Perl/Tk and attempts to provide a solution that should cover the majority of your Combo Box needs. The implementation tends to skew somewhat towards the Java and Win32 implementation of a Combo Box more than the Motif one.

There have been SEVERAL changes since the 0.02 version of this widget -- hopefully all positive. I've spent the majority of the time writing a fairly robust test suite, though there are still a few gaps which are being worked on. A considerable amount of effort has gone into verifying that the unit tests will work on multiple platforms, though I suspect that there may yet be a problem or two remaining (mostly regarding event generation which seems to be a bit tempermental and tests that use fonts). I've also converted my older HTML docs to pod, and updated it to reflect the current state of the widget. Thanks to everyone who contributed suggestions, code, and misc feedback. I hope this widget is useful for others.

CHANGES for 1.10 RELEASE:

1.10 Bug Fix: corrected -textvariable problems.

   - Bug reported via c.l.p.tk [Tk::JComboBox Question - 
     http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.tk/msg/2971450102b53533
     textvariable option not working correctly: when set, a default value
     *does* appear in the JCombobox Entry, however once the Button is 
     pressed, it does not appear selected (or scrolled to) within the 
     Listbox. This occcurs when the Button is pushed once. If pressed again
     the item does show as selected.

     The problem: Because I wasn't a big fan of the option, I implemented
     it in an overly simplistic way, by delegating it to the Entry widget.
     This meant that it if the variable was assigned a value, then it would
     appear within the Entry widget, but the rest of the JComboBox code
     would not necessarily be aware of it. There was code that was "set"
     the value as selected when the Popup Listbox was closed, but not 
     when it was triggered.

     The solution: I tried two different solutions, the one I decided to 
     go with was what I probably should have done orginally which was tie
     the textvariable to JComboBox code, so that stores/fetches were tied
     to JComboBox methods, and there was some measure of consistancy in the
     implementation. For example, before if the JComboBox was in readonly
     mode, you could use -textvariable to set a value that didn't appear
     within the Listbox, which broke the basic model of the mode. I used
     Steve Lidie's Tie::Watch class to implement the fix.

   - Docs and Test cases were updated to reflect the modifications, and I 
     did some more proofreading on JComboBox.pod to remove typos and a few
     inaccuracies.
