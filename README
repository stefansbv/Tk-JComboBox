Tk/JComboBox version 1.12
=========================

CHANGES OVERVIEW: (details below)

  Maintenance release to correct various minor bugs and annoyances.
 
OVERVIEW:

JComboBox is a Combo Box implementation that combines several features of the various Combo Box implementations available for Perl/Tk and attempts to provide a solution that should cover the majority of your Combo Box needs. The implementation tends to skew somewhat towards the Java and Win32 implementation of a Combo Box more than the Motif one.

TEST SUITE:

 I've spent the majority of the time writing a fairly robust test suite, though there are still a few gaps which are being worked on. A considerable amount of effort has gone into verifying that the unit tests will work on multiple platforms, though I suspect that there may yet be a problem or two remaining (mostly regarding event generation (which seems to be a bit tempermental) and tests that use fonts. I suspect that many of the reported failures I see have more to do with a bad installation of Tk than JComboBox, but your mileage may vary. The tests mostly serve as a tool for me for regression testing, and for anyone else who decides to tinker with the source. I'm always interested in hearing ways in which the test suite can be improved.

 Thanks to everyone who has contributed suggestions, code, and any other feedback. I'm not always able to incorporate that feedback, but I've always found it to be helpful. I hope this widget continues to be useful.

1.12 Maintenance/Bug Fixes:

This is a maintenance release of Tk-JComboBox that addresses an 
issue with the -popupcreate callback option. In addition, I've
updated some test cases, added an examples directory, and updated
some of the Pod files. There is a potential backward compatibility
issue with this release (the -popupcreate option), but there is no
major new functionality (At least one new option may be coming in
the next release...)
 
   - Issue: jdtoronto posted a bug report on the Perlmonks site.
     http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=573624. He was attempting to 
     use the popupcreate option to modify the JComboBox each time
     the Popup was triggered. In version 1.11 and for at least the
     past few versions, registering a callback to this option 
     meant that you were assuming responsibility for configuring
     the height/width and positioning of the JCombobox, which can
     be a pain. 

     -- Resolution: I decided that this was too big a pain to pass on
     to users, and modified the option so that the physical 
     configuration occurs outside of this callback. -popupmodify
     can still be used to override the layout properties if needed.
     The result is that popupcreate is simpler to implement (it was
     mostly provided as a means to alter the list item contents of
     the JComboBox). Documentation, and test cases were adjusted 
     accordingly, plus an example was provided in the new examples
     directory that demonstrates the option in action.

   - After conversation with Fred Jan, I reconsidered the implementation
     of the -textvariable option. JComboBox goes a bit further than some
     other widgets and heavily controls -textvariable use. I've decided
     to leave it as is for now, but to hold onto the correspondance and
     possibly revisit it in the future. No changes aside from a tweak
     to the docs.

   - Took another pass through the JComboBox docs to update several links
     that were incorrect, and fix some wording here and there.
