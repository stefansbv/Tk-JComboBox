NAME   Tk:JComboBox

DESCRIPTION

  Tk::JComboBox is yet another widget that offers a pull down
menu like Optionmenu, BrowseEntry, ComboEntry among others. It
was created to combine many of the features that I use most
often under an interface very similar to the Java Swing
component by the same name. This widget may have much of
the same functionality, methods, and behavior but it falls
somewhat short of being a clone. I inteded for it to be
similar enough to be easy to learn if one was familiar
with the component.

  There is detailed HTML documentation in the docs
directory, 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

This code started out as Graham Barr's MenuEntry. I liked 
MenuEntry a lot, but it stopped short of what I needed. So I 
decided to add to it. The more I added (and subtracted), the 
less it  looked like like MenuEntry until it got to the point 
where calling it MenuEntry no longer made sense. Thank you Graham 
for provided the fertile soil from which JComboBox grew. - RCS

Changes:

Version: 0.02

  - Fixed a bug which affected editable mode. It would cause the
    incorrect value to be returned if a user typed in an alternate
    value than one on the list. The bug existed in the getSelectedValue()
    method.

  - Reviewed and slightly tweaked some wording in the docs.
