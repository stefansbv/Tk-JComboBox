Tk/JComboBox version 1.08
=========================

CHANGES OVERVIEW: (details below)

  Bug fix in tests and JComboBox -font option
  New features: 
    - tied to -choice array reference UPDATED to tie to multiple JComboBox
      widgets. 

OVERVIEW:

JComboBox is a Combo Box implementation that combines several features of the various Combo Box implementations available for Perl/Tk and attempts to provide a solution that should cover the majority of your Combo Box needs. The implementation tends to skew somewhat towards the Java and Win32 implementation of a Combo Box more than the Motif one, however it can be configured with little trouble to mimic the Motif implementation if desired. 

There have been SEVERAL changes since the 0.02 version of this widget -- hopefully all positive. I've spent the majority of the time writing a fairly robust test suite, though there are still a few gaps which are being worked on. A considerable amount of effort has gone into verifying that the unit tests will work on multiple platforms, though I suspect that there may yet be a problem or two remaining (mostly regarding event generation which seems to be a bit tempermental and tests that use fonts). I've also converted my older HTML docs to pod, and updated it to reflect the current state of the widget. 
I expect that this will be the last major release of JComboBox, barring bug fixes. I've been working on migrating the JComboBox codebase to a new distribution that I hope to make available on CPAN. JComboBox will become Tk::CWidget::ComboBox in that distribution - I've become a little uneasy about keeping the name as the Java implementation. Other than that, the widget will be mostly unchanged. Newer features will show up in that version and not this one. Thanks to everyone who contributed suggestions, code, and misc feedback. I hope this widget is useful for others.

CHANGES for 1.08 RELEASE:

1.08 Bug Fixes + new Features

   - Fonts still an issue for 1.07 tests on some Linux installations. Appears 
     to be dependant on whatever font is installed on the system. I attempted
     to use Sans last time, but it was apparently not generic enough. I've
     commented out these test for the time being until I can think of a better
     way to test.
  
   - Jack Dunnigan requested that the choices array be made to support
     multiple JComboBox instances; I've put in an initial implementation
     but I susppect that it will be refactored in the future with a 
     better solution. Updated docs to reflect change.

     -- I'm still considering a more generic solution, like the ListModel
     in the java swing api. Something that could be reused easily for 
     the various Tk widgets that use internal Lists.
