Tk/JComboBox version 1.08
=========================

CHANGES OVERVIEW: (details below)

  Minor bug fix in the hidePopup method (cpan#14520)
  New features: None.
 
OVERVIEW:

JComboBox is a Combo Box implementation that combines several features of the various Combo Box implementations available for Perl/Tk and attempts to provide a solution that should cover the majority of your Combo Box needs. The implementation tends to skew somewhat towards the Java and Win32 implementation of a Combo Box more than the Motif one, however it can be configured with little trouble to mimic the Motif implementation if desired. 

There have been SEVERAL changes since the 0.02 version of this widget -- hopefully all positive. I've spent the majority of the time writing a fairly robust test suite, though there are still a few gaps which are being worked on. A considerable amount of effort has gone into verifying that the unit tests will work on multiple platforms, though I suspect that there may yet be a problem or two remaining (mostly regarding event generation which seems to be a bit tempermental and tests that use fonts). I've also converted my older HTML docs to pod, and updated it to reflect the current state of the widget. 
I expect that this will be the last major release of JComboBox, barring bug fixes. I've been working on migrating the JComboBox codebase to a new distribution that I hope to make available on CPAN. JComboBox will become Tk::CWidget::ComboBox in that distribution - I've become a little uneasy about keeping the name as the Java implementation. Other than that, the widget will be mostly unchanged. Newer features will show up in that version and not this one. Thanks to everyone who contributed suggestions, code, and misc feedback. I hope this widget is useful for others.

     still some lingering issues with DialogBox widgets interfering
     with this widget, Including two specific cases where hidePopup 
     tried to reinstate grab to a destroyed widget and another case 
     where hidePopup would try to assign grab to a
     widget that was iconified.
