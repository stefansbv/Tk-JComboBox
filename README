Tk/JComboBox version 1.06
=========================

  [Bug fix in JComboBox - grab was improperly handled - updated unit tests]
  
JComboBox is a ComboBox implementation that combines several features of the various Combo Box implementations available for Perl/Tk and attempts to provide a solution that should cover the majority of your Combo Box needs. The implementation tends to skew somewhat towards the Java and Win32 implementation of a Combo Box more than the Motif one, however it can be configured with little trouble to mimic the Motif implementation if desired.

There have been SEVERAL changes since the 0.02 version of this widget -- hopefully all positive. I've spent the majority of the time writing a fairly robust test suite, though there are still a few gaps which are being worked on. A reasonable amount of effort has gone into verifying that the unit tests will work on multiple platforms, though I suspect that there may yet be a problem or two remaining (mostly regarding event generation which seems to be a bit tempermental). I've also converted my HTML documentation to pod, and updated it to reflect the current state of the widget. 

I expect that this will be the last major release of JComboBox, barring bug fixes. I've been working on migrating the JComboBox codebase to a new distribution that I hope to make available on CPAN. JComboBox will become Tk::CWidget::ComboBox in that distribution - I've become a little uneasy about keeping the name as the Java implementation. Other than that, the widget will be mostly unchanged. Newer features will show up in that version and not this one. Thanks to everyone who contributed suggestions, code, and misc feedback. I hope this widget is useful for others.


Notes for 1.06 release:

  This release includes a fix for a minor bug where JComboBox could interfere with DialogBox's or any other widget that needed to use grab/grabGlobal. Ken Prows discovered the bug, and provided a patch for the problem. I added a test case to test that the new code works as expected.  

  I've also tried to go through and remove line feeds from the code, and I've taken another crack at repairing the test cases (I'm cautiously optimistic that they will work.) The Test suite may have been a bit ambititious and even overzealous, but I'm trying to make it work. See Changes for more details. 

  I'd like to say thank you to Ken Prows (for bug reports, scripts that show the problem, and patches!), Todd Beverly, Paul Allen, Zentara, Corion, Saper, and any others who have run the tests on different machines for me.
